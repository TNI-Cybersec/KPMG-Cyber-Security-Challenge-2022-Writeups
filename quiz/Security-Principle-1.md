## Challenge Description

KPMG Thailand has migrated most of our services and storage to hybrid cloud. Our IT security team noticed there are multiple users who upload and store sensitive business documents to public cloud without proper security measures which could pose a risk to all KPMG member firms globally. As a result, the IT security team decided to conduct a mandatory training session that instructs all KPMG staff on the correct usage of cloud-based storage. Which of the following risk treatment approach was implemented in this case?

- [ ] Risk Avoidance
- [ ] Risk Transfer
- [ ] Risk Mitigation
- [ ] Risk Acceptance
- [ ] Risk Optimisation
